These files are here to construct (and use) the local Gt+ chiral potential.

The potential's code was built by Ingo Tews, as stated in `./src/localGt+.cpp`.
This code was slightly modified by Christian Drischler. 

The localGt+ code is accessed using Christian Drischler's `Channel.py` code. 

I, Joshua Maldonado, did not construct any of the code used in `greedy-emulator/chiral_construction/`.
